# roboMegumin - Add a little explosion to your server

## Commands:

`#!explode` - Megumin gets super excited and causes a "small" explosion on your server.

`#!ping`    - sends a Pong back!

`#!restart` - bot admin only, restarts the bot to load any new changes
## Setup:
Run `gem install discordrb` to grab the discord gem. You are also going to want to set up a discord application, and a bot user at [The Discord developer site](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) application. Once all that's done run `ruby core.rb` to get your new explosion ~~waifu~~ bot up and running
